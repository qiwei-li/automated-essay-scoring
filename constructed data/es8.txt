The reader can easily understand the main ideas. Support is present, although it may be limited or rather general. The writing is characterized byo	an easily identifiable purpose.o	clear main idea(s).o	supporting details that are relevant, but may be overly general or limited in places; when appropriate, resources are used to provide accurate support.o	a topic that is explored / explained, although developmental details may occasionally be out of balance with the main idea(s); some connections and insights may be present.o	content and selected details that are relevant, but perhaps not consistently well-chosen for audience and purpose.Score 3: The reader can understand the main ideas, although they may be overly broad or simplistic, and the results may not be effective. Supporting detail is often limited, insubstantial, overly general, or occasionally slightly off-topic. The writing is characterized byo	an easily identifiable purpose and main idea(s).o	predictable or overly-obvious main ideas; or points that echo observations heard elsewhere; or a close retelling of another work.o	support that is attempted, but developmental details are often limited, uneven, somewhat off-topic, predictable, or too general (e.g., a list of underdeveloped points).o	details that may not be well-grounded in credible resources; they may be based on clichés, stereotypes or questionable sources of information.o	difficulties when moving from general observations to specifics.Score 2: Main ideas and purpose are somewhat unclear or development is attempted but minimal. The writing is characterized byo	a purpose and main idea(s) that may require extensive inferences by the reader.o	minimal development; insufficient details.o	irrelevant details that clutter the text.o	extensive repetition of detail.Score 1: The writing lacks a central idea or purpose. The writing is characterized byo	ideas that are extremely limited or simply unclear.o	attempts at development that are minimal or nonexistent; the paper is too short to demonstrate the development of an idea.OrganizationScore 6: The organization enhances the central idea(s) and its development. The order and structure are compelling and move the reader through the text easily. The writing is characterized byo	effective, perhaps creative, sequencing and paragraph breaks; the organizational structure fits the topic, and the writing is easy to follow.o	a strong, inviting beginning that draws the reader in and a strong, satisfying sense of resolution or closure.o	smooth, effective transitions among all elements (sentences, paragraphs, ideas).o	details that fit where placed.Score 5: The organization enhances the central idea(s) and its development.

Order and structure are present, but may seem formulaic. The writing is characterized byo	clear sequencing and paragraph breaks.o	an organization that may be predictable.o	a recognizable, developed beginning that may not be particularly inviting; a developed conclusion that may lack subtlety.o	a body that is easy to follow with details that fit where placed.o	transitions that may be stilted or formulaic.o	organization which helps the reader, despite some weaknesses.Score 3: An attempt has been made to organize the writing; however, the overall structure is inconsistent or skeletal. The writing is characterized byo	attempts at sequencing and paragraph breaks, but the order or the relationship among ideas may occasionally be unclear.o	a beginning and an ending which, although present, are either undeveloped or too obvious (e.g., “My topic is...”; “These are all the reasons that...”).o	transitions that sometimes work. The same few transitional devices (e.g., coordinating conjunctions, numbering, etc.) may be overused.o	a structure that is skeletal or too rigid.o	placement of details that may not always be effective.o	organization which lapses in some places, but helps the reader in others.Score 2: The writing lacks a clear organizational structure. An occasional organizational device is discernible; however, the writing is either difficult to follow and the reader has to reread substantial portions, or the piece is simply too short to demonstrate organizational skills. The writing is characterized byo	some attempts at sequencing, but the order or the relationship among ideas is frequently unclear; a lack of paragraph breaks.o	a missing or extremely undeveloped beginning, body, and/or ending.o	a lack of transitions, or when present, ineffective or overused.o	a lack of an effective organizational structure.o	details that seem to be randomly placed, leaving the reader frequently confused.Score 1: The writing lacks coherence; organization seems haphazard and disjointed. Even after rereading, the reader remains confused. The writing is characterized byo	a lack of effective sequencing and paragraph breaks.o	a failure to provide an identifiable beginning, body and/or ending.o	a lack of transitions.o	pacing that is consistently awkward; the reader feels either mired down in trivia or rushed along too rapidly.o	a lack of organization which ultimately obscures or distorts the main point.VoiceScore 6: The writer has chosen a voice appropriate for the topic, purpose, and audience. The writer demonstrates deep commitment to the topic, and there is an exceptional sense of “writing to be read.” The writing is expressive, engaging, or sincere. The writing is characterized byo	an effective level of closeness to or distance from the audience (e.g., a narrative should have a strong personal voice, while an expository piece may require extensive use of outside resources and a more academic voice; nevertheless, both should be engaging, lively, or interesting. Technical writing may require greater distance.).o	an exceptionally strong sense of audience; the writer seems to be aware of the reader and of how to communicate the message most effectively. The reader may discern the writer behind the words and feel a sense of interaction.o	a sense that the topic has come to life; when appropriate, the writing may show originality, liveliness, honesty, conviction, excitement, humor, or suspense.Score 5: The writer has chosen a voice appropriate for the topic, purpose, and audience.

A sense of the writer may emerge at times; however, the voice is either inappropriately personal or inappropriately impersonal. The writing is characterized byo	a limited sense of audience; the writer's awareness of the reader is unclear.o	an occasional sense of the writer behind the words; however, the voice may shift or disappear a line or two later and the writing become somewhat mechanical.o	a limited ability to shift to a more objective voice when necessary.o	text that is too short to demonstrate a consistent and appropriate voice.Score 2: The writing provides little sense of involvement or commitment.

The writer employs a rich, broad range of words which have been carefully chosen and thoughtfully placed for impact. The writing is characterized byo	accurate, strong, specific words; powerful words energize the writing.o	fresh, original expression; slang, if used, seems purposeful and is effective.o	vocabulary that is striking and varied, but that is natural and not overdone.o	ordinary words used in an unusual way.o	words that evoke strong images; figurative language may be used.Score 5: Words convey the intended message in an interesting, precise, and natural way appropriate to audience and purpose.

Rater 3 provides a third (resolution) rating for each trait, triggered by the following rules:ο	Standard Rule: Non-adjacency between the 1st and 2nd scorer on any of the 6 traits generates a resolution read.ο	Cusp Rule: If first or second score has all 4s on:o	Ideas and Contento	Organizationo	Sentence Fluencyo	Conventions,and the other (1st or 2nd score) has one 3 and three 4s in these categories, require a resolution. Voice and Word Choice are excluded - it does not matter what scores occur for Voice or Word choice (though non-adjacent Voice and Word Choice scores will still cause failure on (1)).Total Composite Score:For most essays:= (I_R1+I_R2)  +  (O_R1+O_R2)  + (S_R1+S_R2)  +  2 (C_R1+C_R2)When there is Rater 3 set of scores for the essay then the Total Composite Score formula changes to:=  2 (I_R3) + 2 (O_R3) + 2 (S_R3) + 4 (C_R3)    or equivalently   2 (I+O+S+C) +  2 (C)            Note the use of only four of the six traits.
